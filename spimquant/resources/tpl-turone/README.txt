The Turone Mouse Brain Template and Atlas (TMBTA) resources.

The current document is a short description of the The Turone Mouse Brain Template and Atlas (TMBTA) resources for the mouse brain. For a full description of the resources and the methodologies used to create them please consult the main publication (Barriere D.A. et al 2019, BioRxiv).

The TMBTA resources are a set of standardized MRI compatible templates and atlases meant to support the analysis of multimodal MRI data of the mouse brain. They were developped as part of the ImaCervoRepro project, a collaborative project funded by the regional council of the “Centre Val-de-Loire” (convention 201500104011, 2015-2018). They provide a unified and standardized framework for the analysis of multimodal mouse brain data, allowing the reporting of results using the coordinate system of the Paxinos-Franklin atlas. 

The resources function in a common reference space and are: 
1/ a high-resolution (60 µm isovoxel) ex vivo T2-weighted anatomical template and its associated GM, WM and CSF tissue probability maps (TPMs) for voxel-based morphometry analyses,
2/ an anatomical whole-brain atlas composed of 1318 structures, derived from the merge of from the AMBMC brain template (http://www.imaging.org.au) and the Scalable brain mice atlas (https://scalablebrainatlas.incf.org). 
3/ a brain mesh suitable for data visualization with common neuroimaging software (gifti and nv format).

The TMBTA resources are provided at the scanner resolution and are oriented in anterior commisure/posterior commisure axis. Center of the images have been set at the anterior commisure level (Bregma 0 mm). Nevertheless, users are invited to increase the resolution of the current images for using in SPM or FSL for accurate coregistration and normalization steps (we recommand x10 increasing).
